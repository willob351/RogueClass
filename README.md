# Rogue Project

Based on the Rogue character class in Dungeons and Dragons

Written in Python for a class project that was meant to contain one class and 20 methods/variables. It's a little bigger than that!

Rogue class allows players to avoid having to do maths, takes care of all behind the scenes maths involved with rolls and levelling.
Also allows for random or inputted character creation and prints out character sheet. Includes inventory & methods for inventory management.

Levelling up is fully handled, including ability modifiers changes and the effect of those modifiers on attack
Right now this also includes the three different archetypes and abilities/bonuses gained in each up through all levels

Spells Class is basic, including a selection of spells but not all, and not all spells that Rogues can possibly learn, and is included as a class separate to the Rogue class to save rewriting, and allow other classes to use this class if I ever want to make them.
